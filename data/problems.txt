1. In the dng_sq function, file and rank are parameters taken by the function but are never used.
sol1. Solution, if they are not used, take them out, also take them out of the linos function.
2. The pieces that are getting promoted are not evaluating the board after the change.
sol2: Call the dng funcction in the handlepromotion function
3. Come up with a reason why the knight on c6 is pinned in this config (525478667183616654614354335171725833216141856767314262774757672142314243425756627274625628362224362443874827264242836424321214171542152625152618281415252415162423161723221718#q#u#e#e#n2221#q#u#e#e#n3858477475565562635554644564635453636453526767527568458284681352618776587818323276546766756677756667787764657747483837286858261537354526474526143534211112322434124234343433143542454454634443524222333235543231#r#o#o#k432215375251#k#n#i#g#h#t37776768#r#o#o#k434268677778674778681854352828381618542818378248284743583868547468577574722826577281637574716242424241#b#i#s#h#o#p41225257265613243554747362537372246566576885747271#b#i#s#h#o#p5353535363635252535363727468585342711724586667585767438357476768#b#i#s#h#o#p6847366886411486648436262484852436138586133586871425268788#k#n#i#g#h#t262736887636564754644635263642465262362525365474313374626336366354333154663636363666633133665433316373)
cause3: the in function does not see the knight blocking the white bishop.
sol3: in the pin function, add a condition that checks if the second piece found is a k,n or p. break the loop if true cause the can't pin, 
and'll block anyone who tries to.
4. King does not seem to be recognising the promoted pieces (darn it)
sol4: Seem to be refering to 4.1
4.1 I think promoted pieces are ghost to pin function
cause4.1: it was because the value of the promoted pawns are not changed in the cellid function
sol4.1: created boardpid, and two 1 line functions for the board, then let the pin function make use
of this board.
4.2 Why do the promoted pieces not get recognised by other piees immediately they are promoted?
sol4.2 seemto be same with 2.
5. The pinned pieces do not know they can move in the direction of the pieces pinning them, or even kill
the pieces pinning them.
algo5: see the algo.txt
6. When castling for the first time, the mirror rook of your opponent gets castled with your king.
cause6: At the point where it s about to castle, analysis is conducted to find out if the oposing king willl be in check after castling, in 
doing so, the kings function is called, in calling the kings function, the castling function is recalled, which changes the castling data.
sol6: put a condition in the kings functionso it does not execute the castling function during analysis not related to castling.
7. When a piece that attacks the line of sight of a king is right in front of the king, the king thinks going back is a good idea.
cause7: I changed the last member of the nlfdng and nlrdng array to 0, if the lawst memberand the first member are the same, then I cannot
use the real first member in this cohcelldng(b+nlfdng[0], 2+nlrdng[0], 235), hence I use listf_dng and listr_dng to get the original first
members.
sol7: replace this cohcelldng(b+nlfdng[0], 2+nlrdng[0], 235) with this cohcelldng(b+listf_dng[n][0], 2+listr_dng[n][0], 235) in the linos 
function
8. The king's highlight does not show immediately it's checked.
sol8: I created restore_check() function to show the red highlight when the king is in check.
8.1 There are some places aorund the code where I've handled p8 before, hence I need to delete those lines of code as they are no longer neccesary.
